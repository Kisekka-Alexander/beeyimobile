Hi I'm Alexander Kisekka, I have been into web development since 2018.
I've had the chance to immerse myself in many different works and projects, helping to make this world a little better through design & code.

This project is all about simplifying access to current and right prices for different agricualtural products by stakeholders through a USSD application.
